                    <h1>What I do</h1>
                        
                    <p>I am a maltimedia visual marketer for the web and print industry. However, above all I am a solutionist with customer service that can not be matched.
                    Wether I my self have the skills it takes or someone in my network, you can count on me to have you covered with your print, signage, web or graphic needs! 

                    </br>
                    <h3>Everone needs a solutionist in their network, let me be yours!</h3>
                    <!--Since I was a baby I was able to figure out how things worked, at first it was purley by watching others interacting with said items and then grew into a form of play where I would figure out how things worked by inspecting and testing. Eventualy I begain to become intreaged by creating solutions to everyday issues. For exsample at sixteen I created a pully system to elivate my bed when it was not in use so I would have more room for activities.</br> --> <!--Ahhh Words! maybe stop here and direct it to how I translate that into my work. some quotes I love but would they really translate? 'do on to others, as you would want them to do onto you' & be the change you want to see in the world' try these questions 'http://poshcoworking.com/16-questions-to-help-you-write-a-dazzling-bio/' and I'm not sure how much I can grabe from this but there are a fuck ton of questions in here 'http://www.seventeen.com/life/advice/a11164/20-questions/'-->
                    <!--My brain didn't stop at being able to learn and understand how things worked. Because I worked in diverce fields I was able to learn how tocomunicate to individuals of many levels of education and help bridge the gap between what they know and what they wanted/needed to know. </br>
                    There are flaws that come with these abilities. Such as being preceaved as a know it all when scientificly I know that is inposible, rather I see myself as a seaker of solutions, I can fixate on the most minute problem, instead of moving on to the next one, I have been more calculated then a risk taker and most of the time I rather figure it out then ask someone how to fix it creating a more isolated enviornment then I want.--><!--I rather overwhelm then underwhelm</br>-->
                    <!--I am fasinated by what draws people's attention, I have used the science of attraction to cloke myself. I have no desire to be on center stage and find it painful to talk about myself. To some degree that too becomes calculated even though I do not lack soft skills or empathy, I mearly want to save myself the discomfert that being vulnerbal and transperent can bring.</br>-->
                    <!--Ok this is a unprofeshinal run on, I need spicific questions to focus on insted of babbaling on like this.-->
                    <!--*A Day In A Life* </br>
                    From the out side I look very boring, hell if I had to follow myself around I would find myself doing what I can to entertain myself. That being said, let me intruduce you to my internal cercus that goes on.</br>
                    When I first regain concusness (that grogy zombi like self we all know) I some times have a word a famous name or phrase traped on repeat untill I am fully online, for example; clamchoder, Benjiman Franklen or even do onto others as you would want them to do onto you and this is said in many accents and fluxuations. Let me tell you this drives me bonkers!</br>

                                        Eat Clean Live Happy was a project filled with challages and once it was completed, I was able to see the client's satisfaction making the journey that much sweeter. The client and I calaberated well, we bounced ideas back and forth and discused what the the goal and the end use of the design.

                                    <p> Client asked me to create some graphics around the theam of there school "digital". In the past they have played off the digital look using 1's and 0's, but they wanted to visual sepperate the new event with a different look. It being a 'school' I incorperated the timeless 'lightbulb' to portray education and thinking, using the geometric lines to create a digital but humanistic profile to convay the schools intention to educate students.</p>

                                        Federal Hill Printing is known for their quick business card turnaround, but that is dew to their repeat clients ordering their business cards last min. So I perposed to add a sticker or a spont on our next box order for this grapic. The 'Time to order more cars' would be on the inside bottom of the box, so when the box is full you do not notice it. However, when the box is near empty it's a graphic reminder that keeps reminding you the more you pull your cards out from the box. </br> Solutions at their finest.

                                    <p>This client said 'hey I need a business card, fast and don't care how it looks. I just need it cheak and fast!'. Being a designer the is an opputunity to show off some design skills, but being instructed to through the infermation on a card and call it a day made me think 'how would you stand out?', well you wouldn't. But being cleaver and having a background in design theory I know that the most simple designs tent to stick out the most. And boom baby, I give you this! I very please client.
